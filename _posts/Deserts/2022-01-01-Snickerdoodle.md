## Instructions
1. Preheat oven to **350 degrees**.
2. In a large mixing bowl, cream **butter** and **sugar** for **4-5 minutes** until light and fluffy.  Scrape the sides of the bowl and add the **eggs** and **vanilla**. Cream for **1-2 minutes** longer. 
3. Stir in** flour**, **cream of tartar**, **baking soda**, and **salt**, just until combined. 
4. In a small bowl, stir together **sugar** and **cinnamon**. 
5. If time allows, wrap the dough and let refrigerate for **20-30 minutes**.  Roll into small balls until round and smooth.  Drop into the cinnamon-sugar mixture and coat well. Using a spoon, coat for a second time, ensuring the cookie balls are completely covered.  *To make flatter snickerdoodles, press down in the center of the ball before placing in the oven. This helps to keep them from puffing up in the middle.*
6. Place on a parchment paper-lined baking sheet. Bake for **9-11 minutes**.  Let cool for several minutes on baking sheet before removing from the pan.
