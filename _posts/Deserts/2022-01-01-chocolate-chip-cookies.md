 ## Instructions 
 1. Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; **preheat to 375°**. Whisk **flour**, **salt**, and **baking soda** in a small bowl; set aside.
 2. Cook **½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) butter** in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often and scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about **4 minutes**. Transfer butter to a large heatproof bowl and let cool **1 minute**. Cut remaining **¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) butter** into small pieces and add to brown butter (*it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding the rest*).
 3. Once butter is melted, add **both sugars** and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add **egg** and **egg yolks** and whisk until **sugar** dissolves and mixture is smooth, about **30 seconds**. Whisk in **vanilla**. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter mixture just until no dry spots remain, then fold in **chocolate** (*the dough will be soft but should hold its shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several times and let rest **5–10 minutes** until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates*).
 4. Using a **1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.)**, portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2 parchment-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are browning very unevenly (*otherwise, just leave them alone*), until deep golden brown and firm around the edges, **8–10 minutes**. Let cool on baking sheets.
