## Instructions 
1. Note: if you prefer to omit the chili oil, heat up a tablespoon of oil in a pan and drizzle it over the cucumber. Seems weird, but in Chinese cooking, uncooked vs. cooked oil have different flavors and are treated as such!
2. Wash the **cucumbers** and pat them dry with a clean towel. Make the salad dressing by combining the **salt**, **sugar**, **sesame oil**, **light soy sauce**, and **rice vinegar**. Stir until the sugar and salt are completely dissolved. Set aside.
3. On a cutting board, lay a large knife flat against the **cucumber**, and smash it lightly with your other hand. The cucumber should crack open and smash into four sections. Repeat along its full length. Once the whole cucumber is completely open (*usually into 4 long sectional pieces*), cut it at a 45-degree angle into bite-sized pieces.
4. In a large bowl, mix the **cut cucumber** with the prepared dressing, **garlic** and **chili oil **(*or cooked plain oil*), and toss it well. Serve, garnished with **sesame seeds** and **cilantro**.
