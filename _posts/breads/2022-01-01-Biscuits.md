## Instructions 

1. Preheat oven to 425. Sift **flour**,**baking powder**, **sugar** and **salt** into a large mixing bowl. Transfer to a food processor. Cut **butter** into pats and add to flour, then pulse **5 or 6 times** until the mixture resembles rough crumbs. (*Alternatively, cut butter into flour in the mixing bowl using a fork or a pastry cutter.*) Return dough to bowl, add milk and stir with a fork until it forms a rough ball.
2. Turn the dough out onto a well-floured surface and pat it down into a rough rectangle, about an inch thick. Fold it over and gently pat it down again. Repeat. Cover the dough loosely with a kitchen towel and allow it to rest for **30 minutes**.
3. Gently pat out the dough some more, so that the rectangle is roughly **10 inches by 6 inches**. Cut dough into biscuits using a floured glass or biscuit cutter. Do not twist cutter when cutting; this crimps the edges of the biscuit and impedes its rise.
4. Place biscuits on a cookie sheet and bake until golden brown, approximately **10 to 15 minutes**.
