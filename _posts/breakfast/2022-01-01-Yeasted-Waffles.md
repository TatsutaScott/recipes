## Instructions 
1. Melt the **butter** in small saucepan over medium-low heat; add the **milk** and heat until warm to the touch (*about 110 - 120 F* ). 
2. Once the milk mixture is warm, whisk in **yeast** and let sit for **10 minutes**.
3. Whisk the **flour**, **sugar**, and **salt**  in a large bowl to combine. Gradually whisk the warm milk/butter mixture into the flour mixture, and continue whisking until batter is smooth. In a small bowl, whisk **eggs** and **vanilla** until combined, then add the egg mixture to the batter and whisk until incorporated. Scrape down the sides of the bowl with a rubber spatula, cover the bowl with plastic wrap, and refrigerate for at least **12 or up to 24 hours**.
4. Heat the waffle iron according to the manufacturer's instructions. Remove the waffle batter from the refrigerator (*it will be foamy and doubled in size*) and whisk to recombine (*the batter will deflate*). Spray the waffle iron with non-stick cooking spray and cook according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions. Serve the waffles hot off the iron.
