## Instructions 
1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. In a large bowl, beat the **eggs**.
3. Add **¼ cup sugar** and **½ tsp vanilla**. Whisk well to combine.
4. Add **2 ½ cup milk** and whisk well together.
5. Cut the &**French baguette** into 1.5-2 inch (*4-5 cm*) thickness.
6. Soak both sides of the bread in the mixture and place them in a deep baking dish, with the soft white side facing up.
7. Pour the leftover mixture into the baking dish.
8. Let it soak for **5 minutes**, and flip to soak the other side for **5 minutes**. The side facing up now is the “dry” side. You can prepare fruits, powder sugar, and maple syrup during this time.
9. Preheat the oven to **350 ºF (*180 ºC*)**. Grease the rimmed baking sheet with butter. Heat **1-2 Tbsp butter** in the frying pan or griddle.
10. When the **butter** is melted and pan is hot, place the bread, facing the “dry” side DOWN. *The “dry” side is the side facing up in the image on the right.*
11. Cook until the bottom is golden brown. Then turn over to cook the other side until golden.
12. When both sides are nicely brown, transfer to the baking sheet.
13. Bake at **350ºF (*180ºC*)** for **6 minutes**. For a convection oven, reduce cooking temperature by **25ºF (*15ºC*)**.
