## Instructions
1. In a large frying pan over medium heat, warm the *olive oil* and then add the **harissa**, **tomato paste**, **red peppers**, **garlic**, **cumin**, and **1/2 teaspoon salt**. Saute for about **10 minutes**, until the peppers soften. Add the tomatoes, bring to a gentle simmer, and cook for another 10 **minutes**, or until the sauce has thickened.
2. Make eight little dips in the sauce. Gently break the **eggs** and carefully pour each int its own dip. Do the same with the **yolks**, Use a fork to swirl the egg whites a little bit with the sauce, taking care not to break the yolks. Simmer gently for **8 to 10 minutes**, until the egg whites are set but the yolks are still running. Remove from the heat, leave for a couple of minutes to settle, then spoon into individual plates. and serve with the labneh or yogurt.
