## Instructions
1. Open the packets of the **concentrated broth** and put them into a bowl. Mix with **4 cups of water**.
2. Keep in the freezer for **4 to 5 hours** so it gets slushy.
***
*If you can’t make the broth in advance, make the broth with only 2 cups of water and add 2½ cups of ice cubes. Keep it in the fridge while you prepare everything else, and take it out just when you’re ready to serve.*
***
3. Make quick pickled cucumbers by combining the **sliced cucumber**, **kosher salt**, **½ teaspoon sugar**, and **vinegar** in a bowl. Mix it well and set aside.
4. Make sugar water by mixing **1 cup of water** and **1 teaspoon sugar**.
5. Peel the **pear** and slice into halves. Slice one half into thin strips and soak them in the **sugar water** to keep them from going brown.
6. Grate the other half of the pear and squeeze out the juice using a cotton cloth or cheesecloth. You should get about** ½ cup of pear juice**. If you use small bosc pears, use one for garnish and the other for pear juice.
7. Take the bowl of **broth** out of the freezer. Squeeze some **cucumber brine** into the broth and add the pear juice.
8. Mix well and put the broth back in the fridge or freezer until the noodles are ready.
9. Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Add the **noodles** and stir with a wooden spoon. Cover and let them cook for **3 to 5 minutes**.
10. Take a sample to taste. When you chew the noodles, there shouldn’t be any hard stuff inside. Be sure not to overcook them or they’ll go soggy.
11. Strain and rinse the noodles in cold running water until they aren’t slippery any more and are well cooled.
12. Fill a large bowl with cold water and some ice cubes. Add the noodles and rinse them a final time.
13. Drain the noodles and divide them into 2 large shallow bowls.
14. Pour the icy broth into each bowl.
15. Place the cucumber and pear on top.
16. Add a packet of **mustard oil** to each bowl.
17. Sprinkle with some **sesame seeds powder**. Add a **half egg** on top of each bowl.
18. Serve right away.
