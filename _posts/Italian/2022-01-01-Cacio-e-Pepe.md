## Instructions 
1. Bring **3 quarts water** to a boil in a 5-qt. pot. Season with **salt**; add **pasta** and cook, stirring occasionally, until about **2 minutes before tender**. Drain, reserving **¾ cup pasta cooking water**.
2. Meanwhile, melt **2 tablespoons butter** in a Dutch oven or other large pot or skillet over medium heat. Add **pepper** and cook, swirling pan, until toasted, about **1 minute**.
3. Add **½ cup reserved pasta water** to skillet and bring to a simmer. Add **pasta** and **remaining butter**. Reduce heat to low and add **Grana Padano**, stirring and tossing with tongs until melted. Remove pan from heat; add **Pecorino**, stirring and tossing until cheese melts, sauce coats the pasta, and pasta is al dente. (*Add more pasta water if sauce seems dry.*) Transfer pasta to warm bowls and serve.
