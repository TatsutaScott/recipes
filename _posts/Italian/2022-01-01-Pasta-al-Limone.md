## Instructions
1. Using a vegetable peeler, remove two 2"-long strips of **lemon zest**. Thinly slice each strip lengthwise into thin strands; set aside for serving. Finely grate remaining zest into a large pot (like a Dutch oven). Cut lemon in half and squeeze out **enough juice to yield 2 Tbsp**. into a small bowl; set aside.
2. Cook **pasta** in another large pot of boiling heavily salted water, stirring occasionally, until very al dente (*pasta will finish cooking in the sauce*).
3. Meanwhile, add **cream** to pot with **lemon zest** and cook over medium heat, whisking often, until liquid is just beginning to simmer, about **2 minutes**. Reduce heat to medium-low. Whisk in **butter** 1 Tbsp. at a time until melted and sauce is creamy and emulsified. Remove from heat.
4. Just before pasta is al dente, scoop out **1½ cups pasta cooking liquid**. Add **¾ cup pasta cooking liquid** to cream sauce and return to medium heat. Using tongs, transfer spaghetti to pot with sauce (it’s okay if a little water comes along with it). Cook, tossing often and adding **Parmesan** little by little, until cheese is melted and sauce is creamy, about **3 minutes**. If sauce looks tight, add **1–2 Tbsp. pasta cooking liquid**. (*Cream sauces tighten up very quickly as they cool, so it’s better to lean on the saucier side of things.*) Stir in reserved **lemon juice**; season with more **salt**, if needed.
5. Divide pasta among bowls. Season with **pepper**, then top with reserved **lemon zest** strips.
