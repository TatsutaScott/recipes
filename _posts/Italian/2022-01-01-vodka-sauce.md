## Instructions 
1. Fill a stock pot or other large pot three-quarters full with water and heat over high. Toss in a handful of **salt** and bring to a boil while you do your other prep.
2. Peel and finely chop **1 onion**.
3. Firmly smash **4 garlic cloves** with the flat side of a chef’s knife and remove peel.
4. Grate **4 oz. Parmesan** on the smallest holes of the box grater.
5. Heat **2 Tbsp. oil** in a Dutch oven over medium (*position it next to pot of water*). Add onion and garlic and cook, stirring constantly, just until onion is starting to brown around the edges, **5–7 minutes**.
6. Add entire **4.5-oz. tube tomato paste** and **½ tsp. red pepper flakes** and stir until paste evenly coats onion. Continue to cook, stirring often, until paste is deep red and starting to brown on bottom of pot, **5–7 minutes**.
7. Add **2 oz. vodka** to deglaze pan and stir to incorporate, scraping bottom of pot. Reduce heat to low.
8. Using a heatproof glass measuring cup, scoop about ¼ cup boiling water from pot, then add **¾ cup heavy cream** to measuring cup (*this brings up the temperature of the cream so it won’t break when you add it to the pot*).
9. Slowly add warmed cream to Dutch oven, stirring constantly, until a smooth sauce forms. Remove from heat.
10. Add **1 lb. rigatoni** to pot of boiling salted water and cook according to package instructions until al dente. About **1 minute** before the timer goes off, use heatproof measuring cup to scoop up about **1 cup pasta cooking liquid**. Heat Dutch oven over low.
11. Using a spider, transfer rigatoni to Dutch oven along with any water that’s piggybacking on the pasta.
12. Add **½ cup pasta cooking liquid** to Dutch oven and stir to incorporate, then gradually add half of Parmesan, stirring constantly to melt cheese. You should have a smooth, glossy sauce that coats each piece of pasta. Season with salt and add a splash more pasta cooking liquid to thin sauce, if needed.
13. Divide pasta among bowls. Top with **remaining cheese**, dividing evenly. Drizzle with more **oil**, then tear **basil leaves** over.
