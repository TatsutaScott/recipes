## Instructions
1. Gather all the ingredients. Prepare steamed rice first, if you don't have any.
2. Chop the **onion** finely. With the knife tip pointing toward the root, slice the **onion** to within ½ inch of the base. Make about ¼ inch parallel cuts. Then slice the onion horizontally about ¼ inch parallel cuts.
3. Then cut perpendicular to the first slices you made. If the onions need to be chopped finer, you can run your knife through them in a rocking motion. Be sure to hold down the tip of the knife; otherwise, the onions are going to go flying around.
4. Cut the **celery** into 4-inch pieces, then thin sticks, and mince them.
5. Cut the **carrot** into 4-inch thin slabs, then thin sticks, and mince them.
6. Remove the stem of **shiitake mushrooms** and slice them, and mince them.
7. In a large skillet, heat oil over medium heat. Sauté the onion until translucent.
8. Add **ground pork** and cook until no longer pink.
9. Season with salt and pepper.
10. Add celery, carrots, and shiitake mushrooms and mix well with the rest of the ingredients.
11. Add **chicken stock** and water. Add more water, if necessary, so the cooking liquid covers the ingredients.
12. Add **curry powder** and mix well. Cover and bring it to boil. Skim off the scum and foam on the surface with a fine-mesh skimmer as necessary. Reduce heat to medium-low heat and cook covered until the vegetables are tender, about **6-8 minutes**.
13. Add **curry roux** (*one piece at a time!*) and **butter** and let them dissolved completely. The curry will thicken as it's heated up. Adjust the thickness of the curry with water/broth. You can make it soupy if you prefer.
14. Add **ketchup** and **Tonkatsu sauce**. Mix well and simmer for **3-5 minutes**. If the sauce is too thick, add a small amount of water to adjust.
15. Serve the Keema Curry over steamed rice and top with a fried egg, if you like.
