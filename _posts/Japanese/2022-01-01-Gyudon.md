<strong>Note:</strong> If you cannot find sliced beef in your local grocery store, freeze a block of fresh chuck or rib eye for 1-2 hours and slice. See <a class="blankLink" href="https://www.justonecookbook.com/how-to-slice-meat/">this post</a> for detailed instructions. After you slice, if the piece is too large then cut them in half. I use "Komagire" cut from my local Japanese market and I cut them further into smaller pieces.

## Instructions
1. Gather all the ingredients.
2. Cut the **onion** into thinly slices and chop the **green onion**. Set aside.
3. Heat a large frying pan over medium-high heat and add **dashi**, **sake**, **sugar**, **mirin**, and **soy sauce**.
4. Cover the lid and bring the sauce to boil. Once the sauce is boiling, add the** sliced onions **and spread them out. Cover to cook until tender (*if you don’t cover, the sauce will evaporate, so make sure you cover the lid*).
5. When the onion is tender, add the **beef **and cook until no longer pink. Skim off the foam or fat with a fine-mesh sieve.
6. Serve the meat and sauce over steamed rice.
7. Top with **chopped green onion** and **pickled red ginger**.  Alternatively, you can pour beaten egg over the meat when it’s almost finished cooking in the pan.
